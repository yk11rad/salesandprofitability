# README Section
# Welcome to the Sales & Profitability Dashboard script! This tool generates synthetic sales data and prepares it for visualization in Power BI or Tableau, offering insights into sales trends, profitability, and customer behavior.
# 
# Key Features:
# - Generates realistic sales data for 1,000 transactions across five products and four regions, with product-specific pricing and seasonal adjustments (e.g., holiday and weekend sales boosts).
# - Utilizes pandas and numpy for efficient data manipulation, implementing a star schema with dimension and fact tables for scalability.
# - Calculates financial metrics (sales, profit, margins) and customer RFM segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for advanced analysis.
# - Exports data in Parquet and Excel formats, optimized for BI tool integration.
# 
# How to Use:
# 1. Run the script to generate and process the data.
# 2. Import the output files (e.g., 'sales_fact_table.parquet' or 'sales_profitability_dashboard.xlsx') into Power BI or Tableau.
# 3. Create visualizations based on the suggested charts (e.g., bar charts for product performance, line charts for trends).
# 
# Requirements:
# - Python 3.8+ with pandas, numpy, and openpyxl libraries installed.
# 
# Output Files:
# - 'sales_fact_table.parquet': Detailed transaction data.
# - 'product_dimension.parquet': Product lookup table.
# - 'region_dimension.parquet': Region lookup table.
# - 'sales_profitability_dashboard.xlsx': Aggregated data across multiple sheets (Transactions, Product_Performance, etc.).
# 
# This script is designed to demonstrate data processing and analytical skills for financial dashboard development. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your needs!
